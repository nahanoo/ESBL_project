# Morbidostat control

The arduino itself was flashed with the script arduino_morbidostat.ino. Arduino_interface.py is the interface for the python controls and the arduino code. With the functions in this script, pumps can be turned on and OD measured. Morbidostat_experiment.py was used to design the experiment and execute cycles consisiting of OD measuring, antibioitic feedback and drug injection.
