The growth rate measurements are done using an optical detection system that is based on measuring the intensity of back-scattered light from bacterial cells suspended in the liquid culture. The morbidostat can additionally be used as a chemostat or a turbidostat.

Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies {DNA} sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate “hybrid” assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler {SPAdes} and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are low. Unicycler is open source ({GPLv}3) and available at github.com/rrwick/Unicycler.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
	{RESULTS}: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.

Most beta-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics. Until 2003, when measured by sales, more than half of all commercially available antibiotics in use were beta-lactam compounds.Bacteria often develop resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a beta-lactamase, an enzyme that attacks the beta-lactam ring. To overcome this resistance, beta-lactam antibiotics are often given with beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid.},

With a certain probability this peptidyl-{tRNA} dissociates from the ribosome, whereupon it becomes susceptible to hydrolysis catalyzed by peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase. When placed at nonpermissive temperatures, mutant (pthu) Escherichia coli that are temperature-sensitive for the hydrolase will accumulate peptidyl-{tRNA}, suffer inhibition of protein synthesis, and eventually die. Treating cells with chloramphenicol before raising the temperature prevents cell death but erythromycin, other macrolides, and lincosamide antibiotics all enhance cell death. Accumulation of peptidyl-{tRNA} by pth15 cells at high temperatures is blocked by chloramphenicol but enhanced by macrolides and lincosamides. The data are most consistent with macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics having as their primary mechanism of inhibition the stimulation of peptidyl-{tRNA} dissociation from the ribosome. Rather than blocking peptide bond formation or peptidyl-{tRNA} translocation from the A- to the P-site of the ribosome, these antibiotics allow the synthesis of small peptides which dissociate as peptidyl-{tRNAs} before being completed.},

All fluoroquinolones have potent activity against most gram-negative bacteria; ciprofloxacin is the most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Activity against gram-positive organisms is variable; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has acquired resistance to the fluoroquinolones at an alarming rate. Currently available quinolones do not have, but new quinolone agents likely will have, substantial activity against anaerobic bacteria. Some quinolones are also active against Mycobacterium, Chlamydia, and Mycoplasma organisms. All fluoroquinolones have excellent absorption after oral administration; however, this process can be impaired by the presence of aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids and by zinc, iron, or calcium supplements. Ciprofloxacin is also available for intravenous use. Although most fluoroquinolones do not achieve adequate cerebrospinal fluid levels, penetration into other tissues is excellent. Dosage adjustments for renal and hepatic dysfunction vary among the quinolones. Although side effects are rare, concomitant use of caffeine or theophylline with some quinolones may cause toxicity to the central nervous system. Because they may affect the development of cartilage, all fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in children, adolescents, and pregnant or breast-feeding women.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}:
	This paper reviews the literature available on the new fluoroquinolones – clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin – to compare these agents with each other and contrast them with ciprofloxacin, an older fluoroquinolone.
	
	{DATA} {SELECTION}:
	Published papers used were obtained by searching {MEDLINE} for articles published between 1994 and 1998, inclusive. References of published papers were also obtained and reviewed. Abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed.
	
	{DATA} {EXTRACTION}:
	Due to the limited data available on several of the agents, criteria for study inclusion in the in vitro, pharmacokinetics and in vivo sections were not restrictive.
	
	{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}:
	The new fluoroquinolones offer excellent Gram-negative bacillary activity and improved Gram-positive activity (eg, against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. Clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (eg, Bacteriodes fragilis). All of the new fluoroquinolones have a longer serum half-life than ciprofloxacin (allowing for once daily dosing), and several are eliminated predominantly by nonrenal means. No clinical trials are available comparing the new fluoroquinolones with each other. Clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones with standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of infections. Their adverse effect profile is similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Clinafloxacin and sparfloxacin cause a high incidence of phototoxicity (1.5\% to 14\% and 2\% to 11.7\%, respectively), grepafloxacin causes a high incidence of taste perversion (9\% to 17\%) and trovafloxacin causes a high incidence of dizziness (11\%). They all interact with metal ion-containing drugs (eg, antacids), and clinafloxacin and grepafloxacin interact with theophylline. The new fluoroquinolones are expensive; however, their use may result in savings in situations where, because of their potent and broad spectrum of activity, they can be used orally in place of intravenous antibiotics.
	
	{CONCLUSIONS}:
	The new fluoroquinolones offer advantages over ciprofloxacin in terms of improved in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics. Whether these advantages translate into improved clinical outcomes is presently unknown. The new fluoroquinolones have the potential to emerge as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of respiratory tract and genitourinary tract infections.},

Synchronously with the waxing of bacterial resistance there has been waning antibiotic development. The approaches that scientists are employing in the pursuit of new antibacterial agents are briefly described. The standings of established antibiotic classes as well as potentially emerging classes are assessed with an emphasis on molecules that have been clinically approved or are in advanced stages of development.

The enzyme crystallizes from poly(ethylene glycol) at {pH} 7 in space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 49.6 Å, b = 55.6 Å, and c = 87.0 Å. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, and the model has been refined to an R-factor of 0.18 for all data in the range 8.0−1.98 Å resolution. Deviations of model bonds and angles from ideal values are 0.018 Å and 1.8°, respectively. Overlay of all 263 α-carbon atoms in the {SHV}-1 and {TEM}-1 β-lactamases results in an rms deviation of 1.4 Å. Largest deviations occur in the H10 helix (residues 218−224) and in the loops between strands in the β-sheet. All atoms in residues 70, 73, 130, 132, 166, and 234 in the catalytic site of {SHV}-1 deviate only 0.23 Å (rms) from atoms in {TEM}-1. However, the width of the substrate binding cavity in {SHV}-1, as measured from the 104−105 and 130−132 loops on one side to the 235−238 β-strand on the other side, is 0.7−1.2 Å wider than in {TEM}-1.

Multidrug-resistant organisms have emerged not only in the hospital environment but are now often identified in community settings, suggesting that reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are present outside the hospital. The bacterial response to the antibiotic “attack” is the prime example of bacterial adaptation and the pinnacle of evolution. “Survival of the fittest” is a consequence of an immense genetic plasticity of bacterial pathogens that trigger specific responses that result in mutational adaptations, acquisition of genetic material or alteration of gene expression producing resistance to virtually all antibiotics currently available in clinical practice. Therefore, understanding the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance is of paramount importance to design strategies to curtail the emergence and spread of resistance and devise innovative therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant organisms. In this chapter, we will describe in detail the major mechanisms of antibiotic resistance encountered in clinical practice providing specific examples in relevant bacterial pathogens.},

This resistance allows cell-wall biosynthesis, the target of β-lactams, to continue even in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. {PBP}2a is encoded by the {mecA} gene, which is carried on a distinct mobile genetic element ({SCCmec}), the expression of which is controlled through a proteolytic signal transduction pathway comprising a sensor protein ({MecR}1) and a repressor ({MecI}). Many of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying methicillin resistance in S. aureus have been elucidated, including regulatory events and the structure of key proteins.

Therefore, microbiological laboratories have undertaken not only regular cephalosporin susceptibility tests based on breakpoints, but also special tests to detect all {ESBLs}. An increasing accumulation of clinical data implies that the clinical success of third generation cephalosporin therapy is related more to the minimum inhibitory concentration ({MIC}) than to the presence or absence of an {ESBL}. However, the breakpoints must be lower than those previously recommended by many breakpoint committees. In Europe, this adjustment has been achieved by {EUCAST} (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) through the ongoing process of harmonising European breakpoints. In the {USA}, the {CLSI} recently voted to adopt similar guidelines but are waiting to implement these while revising other β-lactam breakpoints.

Rapid detection in clinical laboratories is essential for the judicious recognition of antimicrobial resistant organisms.

Proper infection control practices and barriers are essential to prevent spread and outbreaks of {ESBL} producing bacteria. As bacteria have developed different strategies to counter the effects of antibiotics, the identification of the resistance mechanism may help in the discovery and design of new antimicrobial agents. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by {ESBL}-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Hence, more expeditious diagnostic testing of {ESBL}-producing bacteria and the feasible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteremia associated with different infections are prescribed.},

According to our analysis, the index-{PCR} for sample preparation has no effect on the observed error rate, even though {PCR} is traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced error rates in {NGS}. In addition, we observed very persistent pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The average error rate determined was 0.24 ± 0.06\% per base and the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 ± 1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5′- and 3′-end, e.g., primer binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains very reproducible results. As phasing effects and other sequencing problems vary between equipment and individual setups, we recommend evaluation of error rates and types to all {NGS}-users to improve the quality and analysis of {NGS} data.},

Intensive care unit ({ICU}) patients are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections due to indwelling devices such as intravascular catheters, drains, and intratracheal tubes for mechanical ventilation. The increased vulnerability of infected {ICU} patients demonstrates the importance of effective outbreak management protocols to be in place. Understanding the transmission of pathogens via genotyping methods is an important tool for outbreak management. Recently, whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) of pathogens has become more accessible and affordable as a tool for genotyping. Analysis of the entire pathogen genome via {WGS} could provide unprecedented resolution in discriminating even highly related lineages of bacteria and revolutionize outbreak analysis in hospitals. Nevertheless, clinicians have long been hesitant to implement {WGS} in outbreak analyses due to the expensive and cumbersome nature of early sequencing platforms. Recent improvements in sequencing technologies and analysis tools have rapidly increased the output and analysis speed as well as reduced the overall costs of {WGS}. In this review, we assess the feasibility of {WGS} technologies and bioinformatics analysis tools for nosocomial outbreak analyses and provide a comparison to conventional outbreak analysis workflows. Moreover, we review advantages and limitations of sequencing technologies and analysis tools and present a real-world example of the implementation of {WGS} for antimicrobial resistance analysis. We aimed to provide health care professionals with a guide to {WGS} outbreak analysis that highlights its benefits for hospitals and assists in the transition from conventional to {WGS}-based outbreak analysis.},

As a result, colistin resistance reproducibly increased 10-fold within 10 days and 100-fold within 20 days, along with highly stereotypic yet strain-specific mutation patterns. The majority of mutations hit the {pmrAB} two-component signaling system and genes involved in lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) synthesis, including {lpxC}, {pmrE}, and {migA} We tracked the frequencies of all arising mutations by whole-genome deep sequencing every 3 to 4 days to obtain a detailed picture of the dynamics of resistance evolution, including competition and displacement among multiple resistant subpopulations. In 7 out of 18 cultures, we observed mutations in {mutS} along with a mutator phenotype that seemed to facilitate resistance evolution.},

Closely related strains can differ in the presence or absence of many genes, and the total number of distinct genes found in a set of related isolates—the pan-genome—is often many times larger than the genome of individual isolates. We have developed a pipeline that efficiently identifies orthologous gene clusters in the pan-genome. This pipeline is coupled to a powerful yet easy-to-use web-based visualization for interactive exploration of the pan-genome. The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history. For each gene cluster, {panX} displays an alignment, a phylogenetic tree, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree and infers gain and loss of genes on the core-genome phylogeny. {PanX} is available at pangenome.de. Custom pan-genomes can be visualized either using a web server or by serving {panX} locally as a browser-based application.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to largely gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole-genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly nonuniform read coverage and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler {SPAdes} to a new approach for capturing and sequencing "microbial dark matter" that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. On single-cell bacterial datasets, {SPAdes} improves on the recently developed E+V-{SC} and {IDBA}-{UD} assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (cultivated monostrain) datasets, {SPAdes} also improves on A5, {ABySS}, {CLC}, {EULER}-{SR}, Ray, {SOAPdenovo}, and Velvet. Thus, recently developed single-cell assemblers not only enable single-cell sequencing, but also improve on conventional assemblers on their own turf. {SPAdes} is available for free online download under a {GPLv}2 license.},
