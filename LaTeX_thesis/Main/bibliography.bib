	abstract = {Recent {EUCAST} advice asserts that, with low breakpoints, susceptibility results for cephalosporins and carbapenems can be reported 'as found', even for strains with extended-spectrum β-lactamases ({ESBLs}) and carbapenemases. The {CLSI} has similar advice, but with higher ceftazidime and cefepime breakpoints than those of {EUCAST}. Pharmacodynamic and animal data are used to support these views, along with some analysis of clinical case series. We contend that such advice is misguided on three counts. First, whilst there are cases on record where cephalosporins and carbapenems have proved effective against infections due to low-{MIC} {ESBL} producers and low-{MIC} carbapenemase producers, respectively, there are similar numbers of cases where such therapy has failed. Second, routine susceptibility testing is less precise than in research analyses, meaning that {ESBL} and carbapenemase producers with 'real' {MICs} of 1-8 mg/L will oscillate between susceptibility categories according to who tests them and how. Third, although {EUCAST} continues to advocate {ESBL} and carbapenemase detection for epidemiological purposes, the likely consequence of not seeking these enzymes for treatment purposes is that some laboratories will not seek them at all, leading to a loss of critical infection control information. In short, it is prudent to continue to seek {ESBLs} and carbapenemases directly and, where they are found, generally to avoid substrate drugs as therapy.},

This is mainly due to the emergence of newer infectious agents and more specifically due to the appearance of antimicrobial resistance. With time, the bacteria have become smarter and along with it, massive imprudent usage of antibiotics in clinical practice has resulted in resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial resistance is recognized as a major problem in the treatment of microbial infections. The biochemical resistance mechanisms used by bacteria include the following: antibiotic inactivation, target modification, altered permeability, and “bypass” of metabolic pathway. Determination of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of all classes (phenotypes) and mutations that are responsible for bacterial resistance to antibiotics (genetic analysis) are helpful. Better understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance will help clinicians regarding usage of antibiotics in different situations. This review discusses the mechanism of action and resistance development in commonly used antimicrobials.},

The growth rate measurements are done using an optical detection system that is based on measuring the intensity of back-scattered light from bacterial cells suspended in the liquid culture. The morbidostat can additionally be used as a chemostat or a turbidostat.

Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies {DNA} sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate “hybrid” assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler {SPAdes} and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are low. Unicycler is open source ({GPLv}3) and available at github.com/rrwick/Unicycler.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
	{RESULTS}: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.

	abstract = {The substantial use of antibiotics in the clinic, combined with a dearth of new antibiotic classes, has led to a gradual increase in the resistance of bacterial pathogens to these compounds. Among the various mechanisms by which bacteria endure the action of antibiotics, those affecting influx and efflux are of particular importance, as they limit the interaction of the drug with its intracellular targets and, consequently, its deleterious effects on the cell. This review evaluates the impact of porins and efflux pumps on two major types of resistance, namely, mutational and adaptive types of resistance, both of which are regarded as key phenomena in the global rise of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic microorganisms. In particular, we explain how adaptive and mutational events can dramatically influence the outcome of antibiotic therapy by altering the mechanisms of influx and efflux of antibiotics. The identification of porins and pumps as major resistance markers has opened new possibilities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies directed specifically against these mechanisms.},

While hydrolysis is especially important clinically, particularly as applied to β-lactam antibiotics, the group transfer approaches are the most diverse and include the modification by acyltransfer, phosphorylation, glycosylation, nucleotidylation, ribosylation, and thiol transfer. A unique feature of enzymes that physically modify antibiotics is that these mechanisms alone actively reduce the concentration of drugs in the local environment; therefore, they present a unique challenge to researchers and clinicians considering new approaches to anti-infective therapy. This review will present the current status of knowledge of these aspects of antibiotic resistance and discuss how a thorough understanding of resistance enzyme molecular mechanism, three-dimensional structure, and evolution can be leveraged in combating resistance.},

Most beta-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics. Until 2003, when measured by sales, more than half of all commercially available antibiotics in use were beta-lactam compounds.Bacteria often develop resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a beta-lactamase, an enzyme that attacks the beta-lactam ring. To overcome this resistance, beta-lactam antibiotics are often given with beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid.},

	abstract = {Introduction
	The objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units ({ICUs}).
	
	Methods
	The study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 German {ICUs} from 2001 through 2008. Data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density ({AD}) expressed as daily defined doses ({DDD}) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days.
	
	Results
	Total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 {DDD}/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). Carbapenem use almost doubled to an {AD} of 151 in 2008. Significant increases were also calculated for quinolone ({AD} of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use ({AD} of 117 in 2008). Aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially ({AD} of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). Resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) 26\% and 20\% (P = 0.006; trend test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus ({VRE}) faecium 2.3\% and 8.2\% (P = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)-resistant Escherichia. coli 1.2\% and 19.7\% (P {\textless} 0.001), 3GC-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8\% and 25.5\% (P {\textless} 0.001), imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 1.1\% and 4.5\% (P = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae 0.4\% and 1.1\%. The resistance densities did not change for {MRSA} but increased significantly for {VRE} faecium and 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In 2008, the resistance density for {MRSA} was 3.73, 0.48 for {VRE}, 1.39 for 3GC-resistant E. coli and 0.82 for K. pneumoniae.
	
	Conclusions
	Although total antibiotic use did not change over time in German {ICUs}, carbapenem use doubled. This is probably due to the rise in 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant A. baumannii.},

Competence development has been described for a variety of bacteria, but has so far not been shown to occur in Bacillus cereus. However, orthologues of most proteins involved in natural {DNA} uptake in Bacillus subtiliscould be identified in B. cereus. Here, we report that B. cereus {ATCC}14579 can become naturally competent. When expressing the B. subtilis {ComK} protein using an {IPTG}‐inducible system in B. cereus {ATCC}14579, cells grown in minimal medium displayed natural competence, as either genomic {DNA} or plasmid {DNA} was shown to be taken up by the cells and integrated into the genome or stably maintained respectively. This work proves that a sufficient structural system for {DNA} uptake exists in B. cereus. Bacillus cereus can be employed as a model system to investigate the mechanism of {DNA} uptake in related bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis. Moreover, natural competence provides an important tool for biotechnology, as it will allow more efficient transformation of B. cereus and related organisms, e.g. to knockout genes in a high‐throughput way.},

	abstract = {Drug efflux pumps play a key role in drug resistance and also serve other functions in bacteria. There has been a growing list of multidrug and drug-specific efflux pumps characterized from bacteria of human, animal, plant and environmental origins. These pumps are mostly encoded on the chromosome although they can also be plasmid-encoded. A previous article (Li X-Z and Nikaido H, Drugs, 2004; 64[2]: 159–204) had provided a comprehensive review regarding efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria. In the past five years, significant progress has been achieved in further understanding of drug resistance-related efflux transporters and this review focuses on the latest studies in this field since 2003. This has been demonstrated in multiple aspects that include but are not limited to: further molecular and biochemical characterization of the known drug efflux pumps and identification of novel drug efflux pumps; structural elucidation of the transport mechanisms of drug transporters; regulatory mechanisms of drug efflux pumps; determining the role of the drug efflux pumps in other functions such as stress responses, virulence and cell communication; and development of efflux pump inhibitors. Overall, the multifaceted implications of drug efflux transporters warrant novel strategies to combat multidrug resistance in bacteria.},

	abstract = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted {MinHash} and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences ({PacBio}) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig {NG}50 of {\textgreater}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster {PacBio} data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly ({GFA}) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

	abstract = {During protein synthesis on the ribosome, the growing peptide is linked covalently to a transfer {RNA}. With a certain probability this peptidyl-{tRNA} dissociates from the ribosome, whereupon it becomes susceptible to hydrolysis catalyzed by peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase. When placed at nonpermissive temperatures, mutant (pthu) Escherichia coli that are temperature-sensitive for the hydrolase will accumulate peptidyl-{tRNA}, suffer inhibition of protein synthesis, and eventually die. Treating cells with chloramphenicol before raising the temperature prevents cell death but erythromycin, other macrolides, and lincosamide antibiotics all enhance cell death. Accumulation of peptidyl-{tRNA} by pth15 cells at high temperatures is blocked by chloramphenicol but enhanced by macrolides and lincosamides. The data are most consistent with macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics having as their primary mechanism of inhibition the stimulation of peptidyl-{tRNA} dissociation from the ribosome. Rather than blocking peptide bond formation or peptidyl-{tRNA} translocation from the A- to the P-site of the ribosome, these antibiotics allow the synthesis of small peptides which dissociate as peptidyl-{tRNAs} before being completed.},

All fluoroquinolones have potent activity against most gram-negative bacteria; ciprofloxacin is the most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Activity against gram-positive organisms is variable; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has acquired resistance to the fluoroquinolones at an alarming rate. Currently available quinolones do not have, but new quinolone agents likely will have, substantial activity against anaerobic bacteria. Some quinolones are also active against Mycobacterium, Chlamydia, and Mycoplasma organisms. All fluoroquinolones have excellent absorption after oral administration; however, this process can be impaired by the presence of aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids and by zinc, iron, or calcium supplements. Ciprofloxacin is also available for intravenous use. Although most fluoroquinolones do not achieve adequate cerebrospinal fluid levels, penetration into other tissues is excellent. Dosage adjustments for renal and hepatic dysfunction vary among the quinolones. Although side effects are rare, concomitant use of caffeine or theophylline with some quinolones may cause toxicity to the central nervous system. Because they may affect the development of cartilage, all fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in children, adolescents, and pregnant or breast-feeding women.},

	shorttitle = {The new fluoroquinolones},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}:
	This paper reviews the literature available on the new fluoroquinolones – clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin – to compare these agents with each other and contrast them with ciprofloxacin, an older fluoroquinolone.
	
	{DATA} {SELECTION}:
	Published papers used were obtained by searching {MEDLINE} for articles published between 1994 and 1998, inclusive. References of published papers were also obtained and reviewed. Abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed.
	
	{DATA} {EXTRACTION}:
	Due to the limited data available on several of the agents, criteria for study inclusion in the in vitro, pharmacokinetics and in vivo sections were not restrictive.
	
	{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}:
	The new fluoroquinolones offer excellent Gram-negative bacillary activity and improved Gram-positive activity (eg, against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. Clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (eg, Bacteriodes fragilis). All of the new fluoroquinolones have a longer serum half-life than ciprofloxacin (allowing for once daily dosing), and several are eliminated predominantly by nonrenal means. No clinical trials are available comparing the new fluoroquinolones with each other. Clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones with standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of infections. Their adverse effect profile is similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Clinafloxacin and sparfloxacin cause a high incidence of phototoxicity (1.5\% to 14\% and 2\% to 11.7\%, respectively), grepafloxacin causes a high incidence of taste perversion (9\% to 17\%) and trovafloxacin causes a high incidence of dizziness (11\%). They all interact with metal ion-containing drugs (eg, antacids), and clinafloxacin and grepafloxacin interact with theophylline. The new fluoroquinolones are expensive; however, their use may result in savings in situations where, because of their potent and broad spectrum of activity, they can be used orally in place of intravenous antibiotics.
	
	{CONCLUSIONS}:
	The new fluoroquinolones offer advantages over ciprofloxacin in terms of improved in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics. Whether these advantages translate into improved clinical outcomes is presently unknown. The new fluoroquinolones have the potential to emerge as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of respiratory tract and genitourinary tract infections.},

The addition of the outer membrane permeabilizer polymyxin B nonapeptide increased the antibacterial activities of avibactam alone, ceftazidime alone, and ceftazidime-avibactam against the characterized clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This enhancement of activities was mainly due to increased passive penetration of compounds since inhibition of efflux by the addition of phenylalanine-arginine β-naphthylamide affected the {MICs} minimally. {OmpF} ({OmpK}35) or {OmpC} ({OmpK}36) pores were not the major route by which avibactam crossed the outer membranes of E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In contrast, Omp35 and Omp36 allowed diffusion of avibactam across the outer membrane of E. aerogenes, although other diffusion channels for avibactam were also present in that species. It was clear that outer membrane permeability and outer membrane pore-forming proteins play a key role in the activity of ceftazidime-avibactam. Nevertheless, the {MICs} of ceftazidime-avibactam (with 4 mg/liter avibactam) against the ceftazidime-resistant clinical isolates of the three species of Enterobacteriaceae studied were ≤8 mg/liter, regardless of outer membrane permeability changes resulting from an absence of defined porin proteins or upregulation of efflux.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria set a goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50\% by 2020, but the extent of inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use is unknown.
	{OBJECTIVE}: To estimate the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by age and diagnosis, and the estimated portions of antibiotic use that may be inappropriate in adults and children in the United States.
	{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, annual numbers and population-adjusted rates with 95\% confidence intervals of ambulatory visits with oral antibiotic prescriptions by age, region, and diagnosis in the United States were estimated.
	{EXPOSURES}: Ambulatory care visits.
	{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Based on national guidelines and regional variation in prescribing, diagnosis-specific prevalence and rates of total and appropriate antibiotic prescriptions were determined. These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population.
	{RESULTS}: Of the 184,032 sampled visits, 12.6\% of visits (95\% {CI}, 12.0\%-13.3\%) resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95\% {CI}, 48-64]), followed by suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95\% {CI}, 41-54]), and pharyngitis (43 antibiotic prescriptions [95\% {CI}, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per 1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95\% {CI}, 198-245) annually, but only 111 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000 population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506 antibiotic prescriptions (95\% {CI}, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions.
	{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.},

	abstract = {Three types of phenotypic expression of β-lactam resistance have been reported in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}): heterogeneous, homogeneous, and Eagle-type resistance. Heterogeneous-to-homogeneous conversion of β-lactam resistance is postulated to be caused by a chromosomal mutation (chr*) in addition to the expression of the {mecA} gene. Eagle-type resistance is a unique phenotype of chr* occurring in pre-{MRSA} strain N315 whose {mecA} gene expression is strongly repressed by an intact {mecI} gene. We here report that certain mutations of the {rpoB} gene, encoding the {RNA} polymerase β subunit, belong to chr*. We studied homogeneous {MRSA} (homo-{MRSA}) strain N315{ΔIP}-H5 (abbreviated as Δ{IP}-H5), which was obtained from hetero-{MRSA} strain N315{ΔIP} by selection with 8 mg/liter imipenem. Whole-genome sequencing of Δ{IP}-H5 revealed the presence of a unique mutation in the {rpoB} gene, {rpoB}(N967I), causing the amino acid replacement of Asn by Ile at position 967 of {RpoB}. The effect of the {rpoB}(N967I) mutation was confirmed by constructing a revertant H5 {rpoB}(I967N) strain as well as an N315-derived mutant, N315 {rpoB}(N967I). H5 {rpoB}(I967N) regained the hetero-resistance phenotype, and the N315 {rpoB}(N967I) strain showed an Eagle-type phenotype similar to that of the typical Eagle-type {MRSA} strain N315h4. Furthermore, subsequent whole-genome sequencing revealed that N315h4 also had a missense mutation of {rpoB}(R644H). Introduction of the {rpoB}(N967I) mutation was accompanied by decreased autolysis, prolonged doubling time, and tolerance to bactericidal concentrations of methicillin. We consider that {rpoB} mutations are the major cause for heterogeneous-to-homogeneous phenotypic conversion of β-lactam resistance in {MRSA} strain N315 and its derived strains.},

The enzyme crystallizes from poly(ethylene glycol) at {pH} 7 in space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 49.6 Å, b = 55.6 Å, and c = 87.0 Å. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, and the model has been refined to an R-factor of 0.18 for all data in the range 8.0−1.98 Å resolution. Deviations of model bonds and angles from ideal values are 0.018 Å and 1.8°, respectively. Overlay of all 263 α-carbon atoms in the {SHV}-1 and {TEM}-1 β-lactamases results in an rms deviation of 1.4 Å. Largest deviations occur in the H10 helix (residues 218−224) and in the loops between strands in the β-sheet. All atoms in residues 70, 73, 130, 132, 166, and 234 in the catalytic site of {SHV}-1 deviate only 0.23 Å (rms) from atoms in {TEM}-1. However, the width of the substrate binding cavity in {SHV}-1, as measured from the 104−105 and 130−132 loops on one side to the 235−238 β-strand on the other side, is 0.7−1.2 Å wider than in {TEM}-1.

	abstract = {Tracking antibiotic consumption patterns over time and across countries could inform policies to optimize antibiotic prescribing and minimize antibiotic resistance, such as setting and enforcing per capita consumption targets or aiding investments in alternatives to antibiotics. In this study, we analyzed the trends and drivers of antibiotic consumption from 2000 to 2015 in 76 countries and projected total global antibiotic consumption through 2030. Between 2000 and 2015, antibiotic consumption, expressed in defined daily doses ({DDD}), increased 65\% (21.1–34.8 billion {DDDs}), and the antibiotic consumption rate increased 39\% (11.3–15.7 {DDDs} per 1,000 inhabitants per day). The increase was driven by low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}), where rising consumption was correlated with gross domestic product per capita ({GDPPC}) growth (P = 0.004). In high-income countries ({HICs}), although overall consumption increased modestly, {DDDs} per 1,000 inhabitants per day fell 4\%, and there was no correlation with {GDPPC}. Of particular concern was the rapid increase in the use of last-resort compounds, both in {HICs} and {LMICs}, such as glycylcyclines, oxazolidinones, carbapenems, and polymyxins. Projections of global antibiotic consumption in 2030, assuming no policy changes, were up to 200\% higher than the 42 billion {DDDs} estimated in 2015. Although antibiotic consumption rates in most {LMICs} remain lower than in {HICs} despite higher bacterial disease burden, consumption in {LMICs} is rapidly converging to rates similar to {HICs}. Reducing global consumption is critical for reducing the threat of antibiotic resistance, but reduction efforts must balance access limitations in {LMICs} and take account of local and global resistance patterns.},

The bacterial response to the antibiotic “attack” is the prime example of bacterial adaptation and the pinnacle of evolution. “Survival of the fittest” is a consequence of an immense genetic plasticity of bacterial pathogens that trigger specific responses that result in mutational adaptations, acquisition of genetic material or alteration of gene expression producing resistance to virtually all antibiotics currently available in clinical practice. Therefore, understanding the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance is of paramount importance to design strategies to curtail the emergence and spread of resistance and devise innovative therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant organisms.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus ({MRSA}) poses a significant and enduring problem to the treatment of infection by such strains. Resistance is usually conferred by the acquisition of a nonnative gene encoding a penicillin-binding protein ({PBP}2a), with significantly lower affinity for β-lactams. This resistance allows cell-wall biosynthesis, the target of β-lactams, to continue even in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. {PBP}2a is encoded by the {mecA} gene, which is carried on a distinct mobile genetic element ({SCCmec}), the expression of which is controlled through a proteolytic signal transduction pathway comprising a sensor protein ({MecR}1) and a repressor ({MecI}). Many of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying methicillin resistance in S. aureus have been elucidated, including regulatory events and the structure of key proteins.

	abstract = {Objectives: We propose using {MALDI}-{TOF} {MS} as a tool for identifying microorganisms directly from liquid cultures after enrichment of the clinical sample in the media, to obtain a rapid microbiological diagnosis and an adequate administration of the antibiotic therapy in a clinical setting.
	Methods: To evaluate this approach, a series of quality control isolates were grown in thioglycollate ({TG}) broth and brain heart infusion ({BHI}) broth and extracted under four different protocols before ﬁnally being identiﬁed by {MALDI}-{TOF} {MS}. After establishing the best extraction protocol, we validated the method in a total of 300 liquid cultures (150 in {TG} broth and 150 in {BHI} broth) of different types of clinical samples obtained from two tertiary Spanish hospitals.
	Results: The initial evaluation showed that the extraction protocol including a 5 minute sonication step yielded 100\% valid identiﬁcations, with an average score value of 2.305. In the clinical validation of the procedure, 98\% of the microorganisms identiﬁed from the {TG} broth were correctly identiﬁed relative to 97\% of those identiﬁed from the {BHI} broth. In 24\% of the samples analysed, growth by direct sowing was only successful in the liquid medium, and no growth was observed in the direct solid agar cultures.
	Conclusions: Use of {MALDI}-{TOF} {MS} plus the sonication-based extraction method enabled direct and accurate identiﬁcation of microorganisms in liquid culture media in 15 minutes, in contrast to the 24 hours of subculture required for conventional identiﬁcation, allowing the administration of a targeted antimicrobial therapy.

These organisms have developed resistance to virtually all antimicrobials currently used in clinical practice using a diverse number of genetic strategies. Due to this ability to recruit antibiotic resistance determinants, {MDR} enterococci display a wide repertoire of antibiotic resistance mechanisms including modification of drug targets, inactivation of therapeutic agents, overexpression of efflux pumps and a sophisticated cell envelope adaptive response that promotes survival in the human host and the nosocomial environment. {MDR} enterococci are well adapted to survive in the gastrointestinal tract and can become the dominant flora under antibiotic pressure, predisposing the severely ill and immunocompromised patient to invasive infections. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance in enterococci is the first step for devising strategies to control the spread of these organisms and potentially establish novel therapeutic approaches.},

We sought to characterize the molecular basis of resistance in isolates {EC}18 and {EC}21.
	{METHODS}: {PFGE} was used to study the genetic relationships of the isolates, and {MICs} were determined. β-Lactamases were characterized by {PCR}, isoelectric focusing ({IEF}), construction of genomic libraries and sequencing. A double mutant of E. coli J53 was constructed, lacking {OmpC} and {OmpF} porins. Plasmids from clinical isolates were transformed into E. coli J53 and J53{ΔompCF}. Outer membrane proteins ({OMPs}) were analysed by {SDS}-{PAGE} and {OmpA} by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Expression of omp and bla genes was analysed by {RT}-{PCR}.
	{RESULTS}: Isolates {EC}19 and {EC}21 had identical {PFGE} profiles, whereas {EC}18 was distinct. {PCR} and {IEF} confirmed β-lactamases with {pIs} of 5.4 ({TEM}-1) in {EC}18 and 7.4 ({OXA}-1) in both {EC}19 and {EC}21. {EC}18 had bla({TEM}-1b) with the strong promoter P5 and lacked {OmpC} and {OmpF}. {RT}-{PCR} showed stronger expression of bla({OXA}-1) in {EC}21 versus {EC}19, along with diminished expression of {OmpC}, though with increased {OmpF}. Plasmids extracted from {EC}18 and {EC}21 conferred increased {MICs} of cefpirome and cefepime, although susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftazidime was retained.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: The 'cefpiromase' or 'cefepimase' {ESBL} phenotype of the clinical isolates non-susceptible to cefpirome and cefepime resulted from high expression of {TEM}-1 or {OXA}-1 β-lactamases combined with loss of porins.},

	abstract = {In Escherichia coli the {ompF} gene encodes a major outer membrane porin protein that is differentially regulated by the {OmpR} protein. {OmpR} acts as a positive as well as a negative regulator of {ompF} expression by binding to {DNA} sequences in the {ompF} promoter region. The {DNA} binding activity of {OmpR} is itself regulated by phosphorylation through the kinase protein {EnvZ}. Phosphorylation is believed to change the function of {OmpR} from an activator to a repressor molecule. By using purified {OmpR} and various regions of the {ompF} promoter we show that phosphorylation causes binding of {OmpR} to a {DNA} region between the -40 to -100 region of the {ompF} promoter previously shown to be important for {ompF} expression. As the amount of {OmpR}-phosphate increases, a binding site located at a further upstream -360 to -380 region was occupied. This latter site has been reported to be important for {ompF} repression. Further experiments indicate that the -70 to -100 region is a high affinity site, while the -45 to -60 and -360 to -380 regions are low affinity sites. We also provide evidence that {OmpR} binding at the -360 to -380 region requires previous binding at downstream sequences, which is indicative of long range interactions between {OmpR} molecules. We interpret our results in terms of a model for {ompF} regulation involving hierarchical binding by phosphorylated {OmpR} and potential {DNA} looping.},

	abstract = {{FepA} is an Escherichia coli outer membrane receptor protein for the siderophore ferric enterobactin. Prior studies conducted in vivo suggested that {FepA} and other {TonB}-dependent outer membrane proteins transport ligands by a gated-channel mechanism. To corroborate and extend these findings we have determined the permeability properties of the {FepA} channel in vitro, by measuring the diffusion rates of hydrophilic nonelectrolytes through the {FepA} channel in liposome swelling experiments. Like porins, the {FepA} deletion mutant delta {RV} showed a size-dependent permeability to oligosaccharides, indicating that it forms a nonspecific, hydrophilic pore. Unlike {OmpF} and other E. coli porins, however, delta {RV} proteoliposomes transported stachyose (666 Da) and ferrichrome (740 Da). These data, and other uptake results with a series of maltodextrins of increasing size, confirm the existence of a channel domain within {FepA} that is considerably larger than {OmpF}-type pores. These results represent a reconstitution of the channel function of a {TonB}-dependent receptor protein and establish that {FepA} contains the largest channel that has been characterized in the E. coli outer membrane.},

The time-resolved operation of the Escherichia coli ferric enterobactin receptor {FepA} was observed in vivo with electron spin resonance spectroscopy by monitoring the mobility of covalently bound nitroxide spin labels. A ligand-binding surface loop of {FepA}, which normally closes its transmembrane channel, exhibited energy-dependent structural changes during iron and toxin (colicin) transport. These changes were not merely associated with ligand binding, but occurred during ligand uptake through the outer membrane bilayer.

Resistant bacteria control their membrane permeability as a first line of defense to protect themselves against external toxic compounds such as antibiotics and biocides. On one hand, resistance to small hydrophilic antibiotics such as ß-lactams and fluoroquinolones frequently results from the « closing » of their way in: the general outer membrane porins. On the other hand, an effective way out for a wide range of antibiotics is provided by {TolC}-like proteins, which are outer membrane components of multidrug efflux pumps. Accordingly, altered membrane permeability, including porin modifications and/or efflux pumps’ overexpression, is always associated to multidrug resistance ({MDR}) in a number of clinical isolates. , Several recent studies have highlighted our current understanding of porins/{TolC} structures and functions in Enterobacteriaceae. Here, we review the transport of antibiotics through the {OmpF}/C general porins and the {TolC}-like channels with regards to recent data on their structure, function, assembly, regulation and contribution to bacterial resistance. , Because {MDR} strains have evolved global strategies to identify and fight our antibiotic arsenal, it is important to constantly update our global knowledge on antibiotic transport.},

However, σ(70) (the housekeeping σ subunit) and σ(S) (an alternative σ subunit mostly active during slow growth) recognize almost identical promoter sequences, thus raising the question of how promoter selectivity is achieved in the bacterial cell. To identify novel sequence determinants for selective promoter recognition, we performed run-off/microarray ({ROMA}) experiments with {RNA} polymerase saturated either with σ(70) (Eσ(70)) or with σ(S) (Eσ(S)) using the whole Escherichia coli genome as {DNA} template. We found that Eσ(70), in the absence of any additional transcription factor, preferentially transcribes genes associated with fast growth (e.g. ribosomal operons). In contrast, Eσ(S) efficiently transcribes genes involved in stress responses, secondary metabolism as well as {RNAs} from intergenic regions with yet-unknown function. Promoter sequence comparison suggests that, in addition to different conservation of the -35 sequence and of the {UP} element, selective promoter recognition by either form of {RNA} polymerase can be affected by the A/T content in the -10/+1 region. Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed that an A/T bias in the -10/+1 region could improve promoter recognition by Eσ(S).},

Here we explore whether toxins may function alone; i.e., whether a toxin which lacks a corresponding antitoxin (orphan toxin) is physiologically relevant. By focusing on a homologous protein of the membrane-damaging toxin {GhoT} of the Escherichia coli {GhoT}/{GhoS} type V {TA} system, we found that {YdcX} (renamed {OrtT} for orphan toxin related to tetrahydrofolate) is toxic but is not part of {TA} pair. {OrtT} is not inactivated by neighboring {YdcY} (which is demonstrated to be a protein), nor is it inactivated by antitoxin {GhoS}. Also, {OrtT} is not inactivated by small {RNA} upstream or downstream of {ortT}. Moreover, screening a genomic library did not identify an antitoxin partner for {OrtT}. {OrtT} is a protein and its toxicity stems from membrane damage as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and cell lysis. Furthermore, {OrtT} reduces cell growth and metabolism in the presence of both antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole; these antimicrobials induce the stringent response by inhibiting tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Therefore, we demonstrate that {OrtT} acts as an independent toxin to reduce growth during stress related to amino acid and {DNA} synthesis.},

An increasing accumulation of clinical data implies that the clinical success of third generation cephalosporin therapy is related more to the minimum inhibitory concentration ({MIC}) than to the presence or absence of an {ESBL}. However, the breakpoints must be lower than those previously recommended by many breakpoint committees. In Europe, this adjustment has been achieved by {EUCAST} (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) through the ongoing process of harmonising European breakpoints.

Proper infection control practices and barriers are essential to prevent spread and outbreaks of {ESBL} producing bacteria. As bacteria have developed different strategies to counter the effects of antibiotics, the identification of the resistance mechanism may help in the discovery and design of new antimicrobial agents. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by {ESBL}-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Hence, more expeditious diagnostic testing of {ESBL}-producing bacteria and the feasible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteremia associated with different infections are prescribed.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is the method of choice when large numbers of sequences have to be obtained. While the technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer. According to our analysis, the index-{PCR} for sample preparation has no effect on the observed error rate, even though {PCR} is traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced error rates in {NGS}. In addition, we observed very persistent pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The average error rate determined was 0.24 ± 0.06\% per base and the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 ± 1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5′- and 3′-end, e.g., primer binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains very reproducible results. As phasing effects and other sequencing problems vary between equipment and individual setups, we recommend evaluation of error rates and types to all {NGS}-users to improve the quality and analysis of {NGS} data.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria present a frequent threat to vulnerable patient populations in hospitals around the world. Intensive care unit ({ICU}) patients are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections due to indwelling devices such as intravascular catheters, drains, and intratracheal tubes for mechanical ventilation. The increased vulnerability of infected {ICU} patients demonstrates the importance of effective outbreak management protocols to be in place. Understanding the transmission of pathogens via genotyping methods is an important tool for outbreak management. Recently, whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) of pathogens has become more accessible and affordable as a tool for genotyping. Analysis of the entire pathogen genome via {WGS} could provide unprecedented resolution in discriminating even highly related lineages of bacteria and revolutionize outbreak analysis in hospitals. Nevertheless, clinicians have long been hesitant to implement {WGS} in outbreak analyses due to the expensive and cumbersome nature of early sequencing platforms. Recent improvements in sequencing technologies and analysis tools have rapidly increased the output and analysis speed as well as reduced the overall costs of {WGS}. In this review, we assess the feasibility of {WGS} technologies and bioinformatics analysis tools for nosocomial outbreak analyses and provide a comparison to conventional outbreak analysis workflows. Moreover, we review advantages and limitations of sequencing technologies and analysis tools and present a real-world example of the implementation of {WGS} for antimicrobial resistance analysis. We aimed to provide health care professionals with a guide to {WGS} outbreak analysis that highlights its benefits for hospitals and assists in the transition from conventional to {WGS}-based outbreak analysis.},

As a result, colistin resistance reproducibly increased 10-fold within 10 days and 100-fold within 20 days, along with highly stereotypic yet strain-specific mutation patterns. The majority of mutations hit the {pmrAB} two-component signaling system and genes involved in lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) synthesis, including {lpxC}, {pmrE}, and {migA} We tracked the frequencies of all arising mutations by whole-genome deep sequencing every 3 to 4 days to obtain a detailed picture of the dynamics of resistance evolution, including competition and displacement among multiple resistant subpopulations.

We have developed a pipeline that efficiently identifies orthologous gene clusters in the pan-genome. This pipeline is coupled to a powerful yet easy-to-use web-based visualization for interactive exploration of the pan-genome. The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history. For each gene cluster, {panX} displays an alignment, a phylogenetic tree, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree and infers gain and loss of genes on the core-genome phylogeny. {PanX} is available at pangenome.de. Custom pan-genomes can be visualized either using a web server or by serving {panX} locally as a browser-based application.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to largely gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole-genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly nonuniform read coverage and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler {SPAdes} to a new approach for capturing and sequencing "microbial dark matter" that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. On single-cell bacterial datasets, {SPAdes} improves on the recently developed E+V-{SC} and {IDBA}-{UD} assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (cultivated monostrain) datasets, {SPAdes} also improves on A5, {ABySS}, {CLC}, {EULER}-{SR}, Ray, {SOAPdenovo}, and Velvet. Thus, recently developed single-cell assemblers not only enable single-cell sequencing, but also improve on conventional assemblers on their own turf. {SPAdes} is available for free online download under a {GPLv}2 license.},
